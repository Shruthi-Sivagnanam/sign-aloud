# Sign Aloud  - Sign Language Recognition System

## Abstract
The major focus of this project is to create a deep learning-based android 
application that offers sign language translation to text and speech thereby aiding 
communication between signers and non-signers. We use a custom CNN 
(Convolution Neural Network) for recognizing the sign from a live video frame. 
This system can help in public speaking and students with speech impairment.
